Huge huge thanks to [Zach Winter](https://github.com/zachwinter) for his help on this, there is no way I would have been able to get going without his amazingly generous help. A large proportion of the code used to get me going on this is by his fingers. I will comment this accordingly once the project becomes more complete. ðŸ™Œ
